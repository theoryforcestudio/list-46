<p>The SERP is dominated by niche businesses, which is always good to see. If you were to work out the average DR, it would be around 90, but that‚Äôs just because Amazon and other commercial platforms rank near the bottom of the first page.</p>

<p>The top result is firmly a low-DR domain, so the opportunity for new players is still there.</p>

<p>An interesting sub-niche are crypto airdrops. That‚Äôs like the poor man‚Äôs avenue of crypto.</p>

<p>What tools do you need to collect crypto airdrops? In</p>

<p>order to receive airdrops, you need four things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A cryptocurrency wallet. This is where the cryptocoins are stored after you have bought them from an exchange or earned them from mining . You can find more information about wallets here .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An account with an exchange that allows you to withdraw funds and send money to your crypto wallet. Binance and Cryptopia both allow this feature, as do most others exchanges .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social media accounts such as Facebook and Twitter , which must be public. We will explain why social media tasks are required by crypto companies below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, you will need time! Setting up everything above will take at least 30 minutes of your day if done correctly (if it is not done correctly, you will lose your cryptocoins).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>What are crypto airdrops, and is it a good way to acquire cryptocurrency? Is it worth your time? Free money through an airdrop and staking are similar. There are, however, several significant variances between the two. Furthermore, both entail little labor once set up. They also do not necessitate any financial investment at first. Time investment they do, though.</p>

<p>The best resources for crypto airdrops and curated lists. Medium.com is putting some effort in detecting scams, but you are generally better off at OG forums like bitcointalk.org.  Official project Facebook or Telegram groups are also very useful for finding giveaways.</p>
